        <p>An emoji (/…™Ààmo äd íiÀê/ ih-MOH-jee; plural emoji or emojis;1 Japanese: ÁµµÊñáÂ≠ó, romanized: emoji, Japanese
            pronunciation: [emoÍúú ëi]) is a pictogram, logogram, ideogram, or smiley embedded in text and used in
            electronic messages and web pages. The primary function of modern emoji is to fill in emotional cues
            otherwise missing from typed conversation as well as to replace words as part of a logographic system.2
            Emoji exist in various genres, including facial expressions, expressions, activity, food and drinks,
            celebrations, flags, objects, symbols, places, types of weather, animals and nature. Originally meaning
            pictograph, the word emoji comes from Japanese e (Áµµ, 'picture') + moji (ÊñáÂ≠ó, 'character'); the resemblance to
            the English words emotion and emoticon is purely coincidental.4 The first emoji set was created by Japanese
            phone carrier SoftBank in 1997,5 with emoji becoming increasingly popular worldwide in the 2010s after
            Unicode began encoding emoji into the Unicode Standard.6 7 8 They are now considered to be a large part of
            popular culture in the West and around the world.9 10 In 2015, Oxford Dictionaries named the Face with Tears
            of Joy emoji (üòÇ) the word of the year. The emoji was predated by the emoticon,13 a concept implemented in
            1982 by computer scientist Scott Fahlman when he suggested text-based symbols such as :-) and :-( could be
            used to replace language.14 Theories about language replacement can be traced back to the 1960s, when
            Russian novelist and professor Vladimir Nabokov stated in an interview with The New York Times: "I often
            think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile ‚Äî some sort of concave mark, a supine
            round bracket."15 It did not become a mainstream concept until the 1990s when Japanese, American and
            European companies began developing Fahlman's idea. Mary Kalantzis and Bill Cope point out that similar
            symbology was incorporated by Bruce Parello, a student at the University of Illinois, into PLATO IV, the
            first e-learning system, in 1972. The PLATO system was not considered mainstream, and therefore
            Parello's pictograms were only used by a small number of people.20 Scott Fahlman's emoticons importantly
            used common alphabet symbols and aimed to replace language/text to express emotion, and for that reason are
            seen as the actual origin of emoticons. Wingdings icons, including smiling and frowning faces Wingdings, a
            font invented by Charles Bigelow and Kris Holmes, was released by Microsoft in 1990.21 It could
            be used to send pictographs in rich text messages, but would only load on devices with the Wingdings font
            installed.22 In 1995, the French newspaper Le Monde announced that Alcatel would be launching a new phone,
            the BC 600. Its welcome screen displayed a digital smiley face, replacing the usual text seen as part of the
            "welcome message" often seen on other devices at the time.23 In 1997, J-Phone launched the SkyWalker
            DP-211SW, which contained a set of 90 emoji. It is thought to be the first set of its kind. Its designs,
            each measuring 12 by 12 pixels were monochrome, depicting numbers, sports, the time, moon phases and the
            weather. It contained the Pile of Poo emoji in particular. The J-Phone model experienced low sales, and
            the emoji set was thus rarely used. In 1999, Shigetaka Kurita created 176 emoji as part of NTT DoCoMo's
            i-mode, used on its mobile platform. They were intended to help facilitate electronic communication, and to
            serve as a distinguishing feature from other services.6 Due to their influence, Kurita's designs were once
            claimed to be the first
            cellular emoji;22 however, Kurita has denied that this is the case. According to interviews, he took
            inspiration from Japanese manga where characters are often drawn with symbolic representations called manpu
            (such as a water drop on a face representing nervousness or confusion), and weather pictograms used to
            depict the weather conditions at any given time. He also drew inspiration from Chinese characters and street
            sign pictograms. The DoCoMo i-Mode set included facial expressions, such as smiley faces, derived
            from a Japanese visual style commonly found in manga and anime, combined with kaomoji and smiley elements.32
            Kurita's work is displayed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Kurita's emoji were brightly
            colored, albeit with a single color per glyph. General-use emoji, such as sports, actions and weather, can
            readily be traced back to Kurita's emoji set.34 Notably absent from the set were pictograms that
            demonstrated emotion. The yellow-faced emoji in current use evolved from other emoticon
            sets and cannot be traced back to Kurita's work.34 His set also had generic images much like the J-Phones.
            Elsewhere in the 1990s, Nokia phones began including preset pictograms in its text messaging app, which they
            defined as "smileys and symbols".35 A third notable emoji set was introduced by Japanese mobile phone brand
            au by KDDI. Development of emoji sets (2000‚Äì2007) The basic 12-by-12-pixel emoji in Japan grew in popularity
            across various platforms over the next decade. This was aided by the popularity of DoCoMo i-mode, which for
            many was the origins of the smartphone. The i-mode service also saw the introduction of emoji in
            conversation form on messenger apps. By 2004, i-mode
            had 40 million subscribers, exposing numerous people to emoji for the first time between 2000 and 2004. The
            popularity of i-mode led to other manufacturers offering their own emoji sets. While emoji adoption was high
            in Japan during this time, the competitors failed to collaborate to create a uniform set of emoji to be used
            across all platforms in the country. The Universal Coded Character Set (Unicode), controlled by the Unicode
            Consortium and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 2,
            had already been established as the international standard for text representation (ISO/IEC 10646) since
            1993, although variants of Shift JIS remained relatively common in Japan. Unicode included several
            characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji, including some from North American or Western
            European sources such as DOS code page 437, ITC Zapf Dingbats or the WordPerfect Iconic Symbols set.38 39
            Unicode coverage of written characters was extended several times by new editions during the 2000s, with
            little interest in incorporating the Japanese cellular emoji sets (deemed out of scope),40 although symbol
            characters which would subsequently be classified as emoji continued to be added. For example, Unicode 4.0
            contained 16 new emoji, which included direction arrows, a warning triangle, and an eject button.41 Besides
            Zapf Dingbats, other dingbat fonts such as Wingdings or Webdings also included additional pictographic
            symbols in their own custom pi font encodings; unlike Zapf Dingbats, however, many of these would not be
            available as Unicode emoji until 2014.</p>
