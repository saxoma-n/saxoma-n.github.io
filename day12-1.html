        <p>What's going on here? Why are those buttons there on the bottom?</p>
        <p>I actually learned quite a few cool things today. Pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, combinators and the like.
            If all that went over your head, I don't really blame you, it is pretty advanced. However, I am going to
            separate this page into three sub-pages. It's something I just want to try for my own experimentation.</p>
        <p>I took a look back at my previous pages yesterday and I ws just amazed at how far I had come. Before, all I
            could do was boilerplate HTML. I could add audio, some text, and a little bit of inline CSS. Now, I'm
            creating stylesheets, background images, borders, and much more advanced concepts.</p>
