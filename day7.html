        <p>There are now borders around my text. It has been contained. At least for now. I'm not entirely sure
            <i>if </i> it can get out, but maybe something might escape. Who knows?
        </p>
        <p>This project is getting a bit more difficult than I anticipated. Even missing one day can have severe
            consequences, but it's all good! Just as long as I am able to keep up with the work and not fall behind, I
            can push through and make this happen! No matter how daunting the task may seem, it is always possible!
        </p>
        <p>This just so happens to be what I tell myself at 3 am whenever I have a project due in four hours. Welp :/</p>
        <p>Just kidding, I'm not up that late! I do need sleep, you know.</p>
