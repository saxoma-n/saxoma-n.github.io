    <p>forgot to finish this lol. I guess I meant to do this on the final day but ended up
        procrastinating/publishing/doing something else.</p>
    <p>it's been about a year now. I ended up just fixing the I'm working on new projects, learning more, doing
        different things.
        this was a lot of fun to work on. maybe I'll do something similar in the future, but right now I have other
        things to do.</p>
    <p>Until next time...</p>
