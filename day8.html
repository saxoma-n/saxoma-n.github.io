        <p>Remember the main page? Yeah, that got severely neglected. So, what better use of my time to completely
            revamp the whole thing?</p>
        <p>I still got to learn some stuff, so it wasn't a complete waste of a day.</p>
        <p>Here is an image of the current main page:</p>
        <img src="proimg/w8index.png" alt="kool console-like coder-y webpage oooooo :o" width="1000px">
        <p>I have decided that I am going to leave the about me page as the basic skeleton. This is not due to laziness!
            I am doing this intentoinally so that I can pay homage to my roots and foundations. Also, it's a bit
            nostalgic, even though i am only 8 days into this thing...</p>
