    <h1>Day 13</h1>
    <h3>the struggle is real</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>My internet cut out today, so I'm just going to do a basic skeleton page. No fonts, no styling, nothing new. Just
        a white frame and text.</p>
    <p>The end of the project nears! I'm not sure if I am going to be able to finish the video, let alone the other
        random ones I picked up along the way. I don't know if I will continue this slowly, or if I will forget about
        this. I don't know if I will ever learn JavaScript.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I don't know a lot of things.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I guess the fun is in finding out?</p>
    <br>
    <p>I wonder what would have happened if I had decided on a simpler project. Learning sign language, doing the finals
        study guides with Albert, or some other random thing. I know I was passionate about coding so I did this project.</p>
    <p>Why didn't I learn more Java? I could have made a game or something. It is my main language after all.</p>
    <p>I have an hour left of the video to go, so I gotta start watching the video in class rather that playing
        Minesweeper. Getting on the grind is actually going to be helpful now.</p>
    <p>I promise you that no other day is going to be like this. I just needed a free day.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>It's been a while since one of my pages looked like this. How sad.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Stupid serif font...</p>
