        <p>Looking back is a bit of a habit for me. I always tend to go back and see the progress I've made on certain
            things. Out of all the languages I've learned, I have always gone back to see what I could do before, and
            what I could do afterwards. Checking progress and capabilities is something anyone should do. It gives a
            project more weight and feeling. Also, the nostalgia just hits harder. What can I say?</p>
        <p id="weird">By the way, here are some of the languages I've learned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>A little JavaScript</li>
            <li>HTML5</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Actually, I <i>may</i> get back into JavaScript, but that might come at a later date. I have quite a bit of
            Java to prepare, as I have a big internship coming up. Although you already know this... I also have to
            learn Git and Docker in a very short timeframe, so who knows? Will I ever get back to this? I'd better. It'd
            look nice on a resume.</p>
