        <p>Today, I decided to take a day to go back through the website and look at how far I'd come. Before, I was
            adrenaline-filled, excited, making typos left and right, and learning tons along the way. Now, I am simply
            tired and want to just finish things off. I have to change my kanban board, as getting through the video is
            proving harder than I anticipated. 3 more days should give me enough time.</p>
        <p>However, I did make more progress on the video and the website in general. I fixed stuff, changed the
            behavior of the buttons, and made a cool effect where if you hover over it, the color changes. It inverts
            when you click it as well. Cool stuff!</p>
        <p>But other than that, I'm learning things that are somewhat useless to this project. I can try and do
            something where I use everything I've learned in one single page. However, I am going to do that once the
            project ends. Doing a page per day might have been a mistake, but I can fix everything that I have had to
            let go once the project ends. For now, I am in a rush to complete everything. Thankfully that ends in 4
            days...</p>
