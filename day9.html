            <p>I now need to contain my paragraphs in separate boxes. Just kidding! I'm playing around with some
                features. I think it is pretty cool that I can make little "islands" for these paragraphs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="b2">
            <p>However, it does get a bit annoying having to type out all of these tags over and over and over and over
                and over and over and over again. It gets repetitive, boring, and demotivating. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="box" id="b3">
            <p>Also, I want to test the capabilities of the horizontal scroll. For example, what if I type
                pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis? That is definitely longer than 200 pixels. Why is that
                whole word even one single word? Who decided that that would be a good ida for a word? Which person just
                goes and says, "Yep, that's perfectly fine!" to an abomination like that?!?! (If you didn't know, I'm
                just testing the vertical scroll as well.) </p>
