    <p>Hey, I'm Ekansh Nama. I was 14 when I made this. I really like to code, and I always wanted to dive into web
        design. So when the passion project came up, I decided to take a break from Java and lean HTML 5 for a bit. I
        thought it would be hard, but honestly... 2 ez no sweat. I've been coding for a really long time, and I am
        always enthusiastic about getting others into coding. Even the basics can be incredibly useful in modern
        society.</p>
    <p>Oh yeah, also learn HTML 5. It helps you inspect element better lmao</p>
    <p>Jokes aside, this project was a ton of fun to make. It was super easy and I think anybody could learn this. You
        don't need too much coding skill, as this language is pretty readable. The skeleton was basically done on day 1
        and was super easy to do. All the artsy stuff and decorations and whatnot took a little longer.</p>
    <p>So I guess if you're looking for something to do over summer break, give this a try! You won't regret it.</p>
